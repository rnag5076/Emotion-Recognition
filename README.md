# Emotion-Recognition
This project particularly aims on the classification of a person's face into one of seven categories, using deep convolution neural networks. 

#### Inroduction


#### Features
 - Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions.
 - The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well
 - The idea here is to build a deep learning model which is able to predict emotions of people at real time. We can classify our data into 7 different emotions(Angry,Disgust,Fear,Happy,Sad,Surprise,Neutral)

#### Under the hood
 - Pandas library is used for reading the dataset stored in csv file.
 - Numpy library is used for converting data into image format.
 - Opencv library is used for reading image data and passing that data into our custom deep learning model.
 - Tensorflow and Keras library were used to build the model.
 - Matplotlib library is used to visualize the data and training curves.
